Microwave popcorn ass niggas...
Nigga I'm young with dough
Leather on my headrest
Big chain hangin from a nigga necklace
That fresh kill ya, atlas fire
Weak niggas wanna retire, there's none flyer
I could porbably buy her
You rappin with a big nose but I am not a liar
No Pinocchio, ho's catch the holy ghost
When they see L, fresh as hell
If you want the crowd rocked, I'mma have to tax you
Fly the boy out, hotel in my rack stupid
Before I hit the stage, I'm a have the stacks too
I don't want your bitch, pussy smell like catfish
Nigga's really mad, man, I've been had the rap true
Cheez, nigga, cheez, nigga check the steez
Based God, bless my sneeze
Tablecloth on my balls, she on her knees
I got a heavy tell em
I'm a legend so that's legendary
Cold world so I keep my face extra hairy
Cold ghost on my neck and he extra heavy
Nigga I'm hot, not in the skybox
Cuz in the game posted up like a tripod
Never been the robot, homey I'm a alien
I'm tired like a closed notch, you boys are so not
But I forgive you, you so trash it's sinful
Back so rap hold cash like pimps do
What's on the menu, got a blind ho like can-do
I got a blind ho like candle
See I'm with maxie, we can kick it like jackie
She a runner, we have a track meet
In school, I wasn't the man on campus, see
I was more like the man with the sandwich, b
Microwave, popcorn-ass niggas!
